### The Balfour Declaration (1917)
The Balfour Declaration was a statement issued by the British government on November 2, 1917, expressing support for the establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine. The declaration was made in a letter from British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Lord Rothschild, a leader of the British Jewish community. At the time, Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire, and its indigenous Arab population was not consulted. This declaration laid the groundwork for Zionist immigration and future conflict over land rights in Palestine.

### The Nakba (1948)
The Nakba ("catastrophe" in Arabic) refers to the ethnic cleansing of over 750,000 Palestinians during the creation of Israel in 1948. Following the United Nations' partition plan, Zionist militias and later the Israeli military attacked Palestinian towns and villages, forcing residents to flee. More than 500 villages were destroyed, and the newly formed Israeli state denied Palestinian refugees the right to return to their homes. The Nakba remains a central event in Palestinian history, marking the beginning of decades of statelessness and occupation.

### The 1967 Six-Day War & Occupation
In June 1967, Israel launched an attack against Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, leading to the occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, and the Sinai Peninsula. The war resulted in the displacement of an additional 300,000 Palestinians. The occupation of the West Bank and Gaza continues to this day, with Israeli settlements expanding despite international condemnation.

### The Oslo Accords (1993)
The Oslo Accords were a series of agreements between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), signed in 1993 and 1995. The accords established the Palestinian Authority (PA) and granted limited self-governance to parts of the West Bank and Gaza. In return, the PLO recognized Israel’s right to exist. However, the agreements did not result in a sovereign Palestinian state, and Israeli settlement expansion continued, leading to criticism that the accords failed to achieve long-term peace.

### The 2008, 2014, and 2023 Gaza Bombings
- **2008-2009 (Operation Cast Lead)**: Over 1,400 Palestinians, including civilians, were killed in an Israeli offensive targeting Hamas.
- **2014 (Operation Protective Edge)**: More than 2,200 Palestinians, including 500 children, were killed in a 50-day war.
- **2023 Gaza Bombings**: The most recent Israeli assault on Gaza resulted in thousands of deaths, massive destruction, and a worsening humanitarian crisis.

### The 2025 Ongoing Genocide in Gaza
Israel has intensified its assault on Gaza, cutting off all electricity, water, and medical aid in March 2025, deliberately starving and massacring Palestinians. Over 250,000 Palestinians have been killed, the majority being women and children. Israeli airstrikes have targeted hospitals, refugee camps, and UN facilities. The intentional destruction of infrastructure has rendered Gaza unlivable, forcing mass displacement while preventing humanitarian aid from entering.

### UN Resolution 181 (Partition Plan)
Adopted in 1947, UN Resolution 181 proposed the partition of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem as an international city. Jewish leaders accepted the plan, while Palestinian and Arab leaders rejected it, arguing it disproportionately favored the Jewish population, which owned less than 7% of the land at the time.

### UN Resolution 194 (Right of Return)
Passed in 1948, this resolution states that Palestinian refugees who wish to return to their homes and live peacefully should be allowed to do so, with compensation for those choosing not to return. Israel has consistently refused to implement this resolution, leading to the prolonged Palestinian refugee crisis.

### ICC Arrest Warrants for Israeli Leaders
In March 2025, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and genocide. European nations have signaled their intent to enforce the warrants should Netanyahu travel internationally.

### Systematic Ethnic Cleansing and Genocide
Israel continues its campaign of ethnic cleansing by expanding illegal settlements, demolishing Palestinian homes, and forcing displacement. Israeli forces routinely bomb refugee camps and civilian infrastructure, ensuring that Palestinian families cannot return to their homes.

### Role of the U.S. and Western Governments
The United States under Joe Biden has continued to fund and supply weapons for Israel’s genocide in Gaza, vetoing ceasefire resolutions at the UN and defending Israel against war crimes allegations. Previous U.S. administrations, including Donald Trump’s, have also heavily funded Israel’s military expansion and apartheid policies.

### Western Media Bias on Palestine
Many Western outlets frame Israeli military actions as "self-defense" while portraying Palestinian resistance as "terrorism," ignoring historical context and power imbalances. News headlines frequently downplay Palestinian casualties, using passive voice such as "Palestinians killed in clashes" instead of stating the reality: "Israel bombs Palestinian civilians."

### Suppression of Palestinian Voices
Social media platforms, including Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, have been actively suppressing Palestinian content, shadow-banning pro-Palestinian accounts, removing videos documenting war crimes, and limiting reach on posts exposing Israeli atrocities.

### Algorithmic Bias in Social Media
AI-driven content moderation has disproportionately flagged Palestinian activism as "hate speech" while allowing Zionist propaganda and calls for Palestinian extermination to spread unchecked. Reports from independent digital rights organizations confirm that social media corporations are complicit in shaping the public perception of the genocide in favor of Israel.
